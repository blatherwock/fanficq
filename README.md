FanFicQ
======

Little extension to help with some fanfic related management.

Planned Features:
* History tracking (change links to stories you've already read slightly)
* Track progress through a story (Know what chapter you finished reading on)
* Simple Queue for keeping links to stories that you haven't had a chance to read yet
** Ideally store info about story making it easier to decide what to read (author, word count, completed status, summary)
** Perhaps also adding authors to queue to checkout more of their stories/favs
